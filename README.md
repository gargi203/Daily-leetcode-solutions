# Daily-leetcode-solutions
Hi! 👋 I’m a computer science student practicing daily LeetCode problems to strengthen my coding skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. This repository is my personal log of each day’s solutions, approaches, and insights.

📅 What’s Inside
I organize my solutions by date and problem name for quick reference and tracking my daily progress.

Solutions are in  C++.

Each folder includes:

My source code.

A short explanation of how I approached the problem.

The original LeetCode problem link and details.

🚀 Why I’m Doing This
I use this repo to review my approaches, spot patterns in my solutions, and prepare for coding interviews.

As I progress, I comment my code and write notes so future-me (or anyone browsing) can understand why I made certain choices.

This is also a way for me to measure growth—older solutions show how much I’ve improved.

📝 Contribution & Feedback
All solutions are written by me; if you find something clever or have suggestions, I’m happy to hear them!

If you want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request. Just keep the structure and add comments—it helps me and others who learn from my code.

🎯 Topics I Cover
